# events was before, now it is a restaurant 

Landing page using responsive design with no frameworks involved, beautifully handmade crafted :) 

Following description by sections

##menu
most important elements here are: phone number, which you can dial directly from phone, register which brings up a pop up
asking for contact details and the contact which guides you to the bottom part of the website with full contact form. 

##main banner
since it is a colorful image, bright surrounding colors are used in purple on the title and a light highlight on the 
black text subtitle. 

##discount coupon
simple 2 inputs for clients to subscribe

##about us
using background image that strategically covers 50 percent of the section. 

##special deals
they were meant to be modals :( work in progress

##book a table
this was something new by using different types of inputs and a "double input" for time and date.

##footer
uses a grid for 3 columns: location, time and phone. after that just icons that link to their existing social media pages.
